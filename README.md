# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: 

The purpose of this project is to analysis the altered grades of the Grade 9 students at "Thomas High School". Since the school board does not fully understand the extent of this cause of academic dishonesty. They have turned their help to Maria, who also employs us, to help replace the scores for Thomas High School with NaN's and keeping the rest of the data untouched. Once completed, repeat the school district analysis that was completed in the module exercise.
